    "**Abstract:** This paper contains an experimental study of the two main methods available to solve the TSP problem, search in state spaces and search by means of genetic algorithms. For state spaces search A* and a modification of it, static weighted A* (PEA*), will be used with different heuristics. The genetic algorithm will use a simple codification that will be based in permutations. The aim of the paper is to show and compare the throughput of these two methods over different instances of the TSP problem. And if possible compare the obtained results. "

    "The search has a big place in AI (the kernel of an Intelligent System is a search algorithm). With state spaces algorithms we have some admissible algorithms (always find the best solution) and others that are only complete (always find a solution but maybe not the best one). The aim to use the complete algorithms is that sometimes problems are so big that is better to get a reasonable result in a reasonable amount of time rather than not find any result due to the complexity of finding the best one. For A* will be compared the different heuristics taking into account its admissibility and consistency, taking into account which ones have better information.\n",

    "TSP problem, also known as the traveling salesman problem, is a very famous problem where a salesman has to visit N cities, but it can only pass through each city one single time. Moreover, the city where he starts must be the same where he finishes. And then comes the problem, find the shortest path that meet the previous restrictions. In other words we have a salesman and a cities. Then we must:\n",

But that is just not possible when the problem grows as the number of possible paths is the factorial of the number of cities (N!). For 4 cities we will have 24 paths and for 15 cities, for example, we would have 1,307,674,368,000 possible paths. \n"

    "Was proposed by Peter E. Hart, Nils J. Nilsson and Bertram Raphael at [3] and it is very well defined at [4] and [5]. Its formal properties are well explained at [6]. It is a particular case of the Best First (BF), where f(n) = g(n) + h(n) · g(n) defines the best possible cost from the initial state to n to the moment. Notice that h(n) therefore is a positive estimate of the minimum cost from n to the nearest final state. The h function has to defined in such a way that it adds information about the problem domain. Its cost is not something not to take care about, and that's why ideally should be polynomial. At the *aima-java* prototype we have 3 different versions (normal, rectify and reinsert), described at [6]."

The starting point is a fixed size population of chromosomes and it is evolved though some generations (by means of the cross operator). On each \"evolution\" it is intended to keep those qualities from the previous generation that are relevant. To evaluate the quality of a chromosome, it is coded (to transform it as a solution) and then it is applied a fitness function, that, it is the unique that adds knowledge about the problem.
